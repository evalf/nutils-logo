The Nutils logo
====

The present repository holds the final artwork of the Nutils project logo. With
[TikZ/PGF] (http://pgf.sourceforge.net/) and [Poppler]
(http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) installed, running `make` will generate the
logo as pdf, svg, several sizes of png, and a favicon.ico.

The details behind the realization of this logo can be read in [this discussion
thread] (https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/11). On a most prominent level
the logo represents the letters N and U, first letters of the name and initials
to Numerical Utilities. On a second level, the colors match that of the [python
logo] (http://www.python.org/community/logos/), referencing the main language
that nutils is developed in. And on a third level, for those that care to see
it, it is a noodle dangling from a blue bowl.

This being a work of collaboration, the result is one that can only be
attributed to all contributers as a group. Our express gratitude to the
creators of this logo:

  * Pieter Barendrecht
  * Rody van Tuijl
  * Timo van Opstal
  * Freek de Bruin
  * Harald van Brummelen
  * Wijnand Hoitinga
  * Clemens Verhoosel

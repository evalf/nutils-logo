The Nutils Logo
===============

The present repository holds the final artwork of the Nutils project logo.
With [povray] (http://www.povray.org/) installed, running `make` will generate
the logo in several sizes of png, as well as a favicon.ico. In addition, `make
logo123.png` (change for any number) will generate the logo in pixel dimensions
123x123.

The details behind the realization of this logo can be read in [this discussion
thread] (https://github.com/nutils/nutils/issues/11). The logo represents the
letters N and U for Numerical Utilities. The colors are selected to match those
of the [Python logo] (http://www.python.org/community/logos/), referencing the
main language that Nutils is developed in.

This being a work of collaboration, the result is one that can only be
attributed to all contributers as a group. Our express gratitude goes to the
creators of this logo:

  * Pieter Barendrecht
  * Rody van Tuijl
  * Timo van Opstal
  * Freek de Bruin
  * Harald van Brummelen
  * Wijnand Hoitinga
  * Clemens Verhoosel
